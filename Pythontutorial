Welcome to the world of Python programming! Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language. To start, let’s try creating a simple "Hello, World!" program. In Python, you can display text by using the print() function. Try this:


python:
print("Hello, World!")



When you run this, Python will output the text: Hello, World! — simple, right? Now, let’s dive into variables. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. You can just assign a value directly. For example:


python:
name = "Alice"
age = 25



Here, name holds a string, and age holds an integer. Want to combine them? You can use print() again:

python:
print(name + " is " + str(age) + " years old.")

Notice how we convert age to a string with str() because Python can’t concatenate strings and numbers directly. Ready to experiment? Try changing the values and see what happens! Keep exploring, and soon you'll be writing your own Python programs.
